This project is a clone of regex101.com built using Flask, a Python web framework. The goal of the project is to provide a web-based regular expression tester that allows users to test their regular expressions and see the results in real-time. The application should allow users to enter a regular expression and a test string, and then display the results of the match or highlight the parts of the string that match the regular expression. The project should also include features such as the ability to save and load regular expressions, share regular expressions via URL, and provide syntax highlighting for regular expressions. By completing this project, you will gain experience building web applications using Flask, as well as gain a better understanding of regular expressions and how they work.
